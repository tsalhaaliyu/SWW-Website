 <p>Guerrilla Warfare is a form of irregular warfare in which small groups of combatant/forces (para military, armed civilians)
 use military tactics <br>like ambushes, raid, sabotage, hit and run tactics and mobility to fight a larger and less mobile traditional
 forces/military. It’s also a military<br> or paramilitary operation conducted by irregular forces fighting on conventional affairs of the government. 
 
 Guerrilla tactics focus on avoiding<br> head-on confrontations with enemy armies, instead engaged in limited skirmishes with the goal of exhausting 
 adversaries and forcing them to <br>withdraw. Guerrilla groups often depend on the logistical and political support of either the local population or 
 foreign sponsor/backers who do not engaged<br> in armed struggle but sympathize with the Guerrilla group efforts. Use of IED’s in the destruction of

Tactics and Strategy: Tactically, guerrillas usually avoid confrontation with large units and formations of enemy troops but seek and <br>attack small groups of enemy personnel and resources to gradually deplete the opposing force while minimizing their own losses. The guerrilla prizes <br>mobility, secrecy, and surprise, organizing in small units and taking advantage of terrain that is difficult for larger unit to use. Strategically, <br>Guerrilla Warfare is a type of asymmetric warfare, that is, competition between opponent of unequal strength and they<br> aim not simply to defeat an enemy, but to win popular support and political influence to the enemy’s cost.
