An attack of this nature will depend heavily on the element of surprise and may force the enemy to fight in an unexpected and unfavourable area.
<h4>PURPOSE OF INFILTRATION </h4>
<p>
 <ol>
  <li>To filter unseen through forward position order to teach reach objectives on infiltration troop may wish to.</li>
  <li>Seize a piece of ground of ladical importance behind forward position so as to isolate or ambush the enemy.</li>
  <li>Attack a key position in depth. Possibly while forward position of the enemy are attacked simultaneously.</li>
  <li>To destroy a strong hold of enemy </li>

  <li>To seize important tactical feature such as bridges high ground and communication centre.</li>
  <li>To disrupt and delay or hold the movement of enemy supporting units and reserves</li>
  <li>To stage a deception for operation in other areas.</li>
 </ol>
</p>
<h3>REQUIREMENT AFTER ACCOMPLISHING A MISSION </h3>
<p>
 <ol>
  <li>Accomplishing and dispatch </li>
  <li>Accomplishing and hold the ground (standing patrol defence) </li>
<h3>REQUIREMENT FOR INFILTRATION </h3>
<p>
 <ol>
  <li>A high standard of training (both individual and group)</li>
  <li>Boldness in planning and execution </li>
  <li>Adequate intelligence about the enemyâ€™s strength location </li>
  <li>Stealth in navigation especially in the jungle </li>
  <li>Detailed planning and rehearsals.</li>
  <li>Moral must be high.</li>
 </ol>
</p>
<h3>PRINCIPLES OF INFILTRATION</h3>
<p>
 <ol>
  <li>Locating enemy position must be known in details.</li>
  <li>Infiltration post must have enough troops and equipment to execute the task.</li>
  <li>Objectives should be permit to resupply by air especially for mission that will last for a day.</li>

 </ol>
</p> 
<h4>. METHOD OF INFILTRATION</h4>
<p>
 <ol>
  <li>By root </li>
  <li>Air clubbing behind enemy line</li>
  <li>Amphibious e.g using water ways seas, rivers, streams.</li>
 </ol>
</p> 
<h3>CONDUCT OF INFILTRATION </h3>  
<p>
 <ol>
  <li>Preparatory Stage:</li>
   <ul>
    <li>Intelligent information E.G</li>
    <li> by recce patrol </li>
    <li> by air</li>
    <li>by continuous map sticky</li>
    <li>intelligent report</li>
    <li> map briefing.</li>
   </ul>
  <li>Execution Stage:</li>
  <ul>
   <li>the assemble of forces in enemy rear </li>
   <li>linkup or ex infiltration </li>
   <li>execution of the mission.Condition which favours infiltration </li>
   <li>Enemy deployment and activities e.g lack of surveillance devices, poor patrolling, all this will render infiltrating troops undetected. Infiltration is favourable when the enemy is deployed in a wide front with large gaps between locations.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Terrain: the types of terrain suitable for infiltration are:</li>
  <li>thick forested area</li>
  <li>Broken and difficult ground</li>
  <li>Standing crops</li>
 The following restrict enemy observation, surveillance and afford batter concealment for movement, the rougher and more difficult the terrain the batter for infiltration
 <li>Weather: a very poor visibility enhance the benefit of infiltration e.g. darkness, adverse weather such as harmattan , smoke and heavy rain fall.   </li>
