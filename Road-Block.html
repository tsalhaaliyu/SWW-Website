<h4>DEFINATON</h4>

<h3>TYPES OF ROAD BLOCKS</h3>
<p>
 <ol>
  <h4><li>SNAP ROADBLOCK.</li></h4>
These one used for spot checks, sometimes acting on some item of intelligence. Initially they may achieve surprise and success, but once the<br> position is generally known, in urban areas seldom longer than ten minutes they quickly lose their usefulness.   
 <h4><li>DELIBERATE ROADBLOCK</li></h4>
These are of a permanent or semi-permanent in nature and may be placed on a main road perhaps near a boarder on the outskirt of a city or on the<br> edge of a controlled area. They are a deterrent and one unlikely to produce spectacular results.  
 <h4><li>COVERT ROADBLOCK.</li></h4>
This is a variation of the snap roadblock, usually used in urban and rural areas in circumstance where it is often easy for anyone to face avoiding action sighting a roadblock in operation.
 </ol>
</p>
<h4>REASONS FOR ROAD BLOCK</h4>
Road blocks may have one or more of the following aims:
<p>
 <ol>
  <li>To maintain a broad check or road movement.</li>
  <li>To apprehend wanted vehicles or persons.</li>
  <li>To frustrate the movement of arms, ammo and explosive.</li>
  <li>Assist in enforcing, control of movement both of people and materials.</li>
 </ol>
</p>
<h4>PRINCIPLES OF ROAD BLOCK</h4>
All troops manning a roadblock must know their job thoroughly and act quickly and methodically. There must be politeness in manner of approach. <br>Consideration must be shown at all times and the greatest care taken which a consistent with a thorough search. Any suspects arrested should be<br> handed over to the civil police as soon as possible. The following are the principles of deliberate roadblocks.
<p>
 <ol>
  <li>Concealment.</li>
  <li>Security.</li>
  <li>Construction and layout.</li>
  <li>Manning,</li>
  <li>Surveillance devices.</li>
  <li>Search equipment.</li>
  <li>Communication.</li>
 </ol>
</p>
<h4>CONCEALMENT</h4>
<p>
The roadblock should be sited tactically where it cannot be seen from more than a short distance away. Sharp bends or dips in the road provide good position with assurance of safety. There should be no room for an approaching vehicle takes avoiding action by turning, leaving the road or revels.
</p>
<h4>SECURITY</h4>
<p>
There must be enough troops to protect the road block sentryâ€™[s should be sited as back stops on both sides will clear of the search area to watch approaching traffic and prevent evasion. When the threat of attack on a road block is likely, then the block itself must have a pick up force. The likely roadblock sides must be checked against booby-trapping and ambushes.
</p>
<h4>CONSTRUCTION AND LAYOUT</h4>
A simple construction is two parallel times of knife risk, each with a gap, the road a proximately 50m apart. The enclosure formed can then be used as search area. There should be the following:
<p>
 <ol>
  <li>Separate male and female search areas.</li>
  <li>Vehicle waiting area.</li>
  <li>Vehicle search area.</li>
  <li>A cadge for detailing persons prior to have being handed over to the police.</li>
  <li>	Roadblock HQ.</li>
  <li>Administrative area.</li>
 </ol>
</p>
<h4>PLANNING</h4>
<p>
The number of troops required will depend upon the number of road to be covered and the expected volume of traffic. If personnel are to be searched, there must be women searchers and special accommodation must be provided. The military commander should where possible be of the rank of sergeant to captain. An interpreter may also be necessary and early warning devices to give warning of an approaching vehicle may be value.
</p>
<h4>SEARCH EQUIPMENT</h4>
<p>
Special equipment for searching a heavy or complicated vehicle loads may be needed.
</p>
<h4>COMMUNICATIONS</h4>
<p>
External communications are essential so that revised instruction may be given, information at wanted passed quickly and incidents at the roadblock reported. Internal communications within a large roadblock can speed reaction time.
