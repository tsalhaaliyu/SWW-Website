<p>The problem of internal security crisis and insurgency cannot be properly understood nor 
decoded, unless the analysis and the interpretation of the underlining causes, types, 
effects and solution are premised on the contemporary global financial and economic 
crisis. The under currents of the inter connectedness between the contemporary nation 
states pose a fundamental challenge of the issues of internal security, conflict 
management and at development especially to the developing third world countries. 
In the contemporary world if has become extremely difficult to divorce internal 
security from external pressures. Indeed, internal security is symbiotically linked with 
the global politics and its other dynamics. For example while the revolution in the 
information technology has impacted positively on the global economic, it has also 
radicalized the perceptions of the victims of global politics on the issues of justice, 
poverty, ethnicity and inequalities arising from the contradiction of western 
imperialism. It has reawakened the minds of the oppressed to seek for justice and 
equity outside the framework of the nation state.
