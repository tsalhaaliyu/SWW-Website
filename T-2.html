      <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
      <p/>Here, we deduce the backbone concepts that aid our understanding of what revolutions in International Relations.</p>
      <ol>
          <li><b>WHAT IS A REVOLUTION</b></li>
          <p>     
can be said to be a rapid, fundamental and violent domestic change in the dominant 
values and myths of a society, be it in its political institutions, leadership, 
government activities and policies. 

Revolutions are rapid 
and basic transformation of a society, state and class structure as they are 
accompanied and in part carried out by class-based revolt from below .
  
Revolutions to involve the downfall of an old regime through violent 
means and its replacement by a new regime that attempts to establish a new political 
and social order. In all, a revolution is centred on change from an established 
structure to a new one be it for better or worse, all with their inherent consequencesand  realities.

<ul>
    <li><b>Revolutions can be of different types such as</b></li>
   <ol>
       <li>Social Revolution</li>
       <li>Political Revolution</li>
       <li>Cultural Revolutions</li>
       <li> Scientific Revolutions</li>
       <li>Moral Revolutions.</li>
       <li>Health Revolutions. etc.</li>
       <li>Religious Revolutions</li>
   </ol>  
</u>      
</p>
<p>
   <h3><b>Revolutions can be characterized by four main traits; they are</b></h3>
   <ol>
       <li>Sudden</li>
       <li>Violent</li>
       <li>. Require political replacement, and</li>
       <li> Lead to major replacement (political, socio-economic, etc.) changes to the system.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>
     A moderate response to such opinion is that revolutions involve violence not 
necessarily from the revolutionary movement, but from the various system they 
canvass against, to change. In said situation, the power of established systems and 
their desire to maintain the status-quo will make their use of force to retain such a 
condition unavoidable. 
   </p>
</p>

<p>
   <h3><b>THE REVOLUTIONARY PROCESS</b></h3>
   <h3><b>WHAT IS THE REVOLUTIONARY PROCESS</b></h3>
   <p>The Revolutionary Process can be viewed as a series of actions or steps taken by 
elements germane to a revolution in order to achieve a revolutionary end. Such a 
process is not set in stone, i.e. any of this may come before the other. The process 
involves step, decision, response. In understanding the revolutionary process, it must 
be stated that the process of a revolution may begin but must not necessarily end.</p>
</p>
<p>
    <h3><b>REVOLUTIONARY CONDITIONS/SITUATIONS</b></h3>
    <p>For a revolution to occur, certain conditions/situation must be met, the most 
important of which must be a situation that requires a change, this condition must 
have lingered over time such that it warrants a revolutionary response. E.g. the Sit-
Tight Syndrome of Authoritarian regime.
  </p>
</p>
<h3><b>THE REVOLUTIONARY</b></h3>
  <p>Revolutionary is an individual or group who have a desire to pursue a revolutionary 
change in society. These persons are driven and committed as well as will most likely 
populate the leadership ladder of the Revolution. They most times are the initiator 
or sustainers of a revolutionary movement. Likewise, they are a rallying point for 
revolutionary activities. E.g. Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, etc.</p>
 <h3><b>REVOLUTIONARY IDEAS</b></h3>
 <p>Revolutionary Ideas entails the dominant views that form the ideological foundation 
of the revolutionary groups. It covers the idea of the change that is clamoured for 
and how that change should be achieved. It can be said to be the Revolution in mind.</p>

<h3><b>REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT</b></h3>
 <p>A revolutionary movement is a group of persons who are joint together in a platform. 
They have as their core objective a desire or commitment to bring about a change to 
the established system. They are violent in their operation or non-violent. E.g. Red 
Card Movement (Nigeria), The Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF), etc</p>

<p>
    <h3><b>REVOLUTIONARY WARFARE</b></h3>
    <p>Revolutionary warfare is a campaign of violence by a revolutionary movement 
representing an alternative to a current regime. Such occurs by mobilizing sufficient 
element of the population to threaten the established system. It usually results from 
the failure of peaceful means to change a revolutionary condition. E.g. The 
Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger-Delta (MEND).</p>
</p>

<p>
    <he><b> TYPES OF REVOLUTION</b></h3>
    Revolutions are tagged various labels as a form of typological nomenclature. Said 
typological nomenclature emerge for their instigators, core issues, agenda or 
purpose, which lead to the Revolution.
<ol>
<li><h4><b>ARISTOCRATIC REVOLUTION</b></h4></li>

 <p>Such Revolution occurs from a crack in the unison of the aristocratic (privileged and 
entrenched elites) class of society. In such a situation, factions are formed, and one 
of such emerge to challenge the established order. The cause here could because of 
lost benefits from the current system or other reasons. E.g. The Meji Revolution</p>



        <li><h4><b>BOURGEOIS REVOLUTION</b></h4></li>
<p>Here, this Revolution emerges from the non-aristocratic or noble, wealthy elites of 
society. Said class is populated by wealthy entrepreneur, merchants, profession who have the resources to form a potent political force. The Bourgeois seeks to open up 
the space of political participation from the hands of a privileged elite few. Hence, 
they seek expanded power in a change of unfair conditions that inhibit them. E.g., 
The French Revolution etc</p>

        <li><h4><b>PROLETARIAN REVOLUTION</b></h4></li>
 <p>A proletarian Revolution is one championed mostly by the working class or as Karl 
Marx term it as the "Have Not." Here, the group that leads said Revolution are 
usually radical. They seek to unseat an unjust economic or political order, that keeps 
them subservient, exploited and downtrodden. E.g. The Bolshevik Revolution</p>

        <li><h4><b>PEASANT REVOLUTION</b></h4></li>
 <p> Revolution is such that has been phased out of modern International Society. 
It occurred in the past, in a situation where peasants (serfs or subservient class; tied 
to the land), as the lowest class in society, rise to overthrow their landlord or landed 
masters. E.g., the Red Turban Revolution
</p> 
      <li><h4><b>COUP D'ETAT</b></h4></li>
      
<p>Coup D' Etats are seen controversially as a type of Revolution. However, that is not 
without challenge to its suitability in being termed as such. A Coup is a forceful 
action aimed at the overthrow of the political leadership of a system. It usually involves a small group within the government structure. Not necessarily linked to 
fundamental change. E.g. January 15TH 1966 Coup in Nigeria,</p> 
     

  </ol>
</p> 
 
<p>
    <h2><b>STAGES OF A REVOLUTION</b></h2>
    
<p>Scholars of revolutionary events in international relations have from their 
observations deduced that Revolutions do not occur in isolation, some actions lead 
up to what pans out as Revolutions. Such logic lead to what they term the stages of 
a Revolution. Hence, several of such Stages have been proposed by scholars based 
on their perspective. And so, one of the most prominent is that given by Crane 
Brinton in his book "The Anatomy of A Revolution." Hence, Crane Brinton, in 
his book "The Anatomy of A Revolution" presented four stages of a revolution.</p> 
 
   <ol>
    <li><h4><b>THE INCUBATION STAGE</b></h4></li>
    
  <p>In this stage, the symptoms of a revolution are shown before the outbreak of the 
Revolution. Such symptoms can include economic crisis, sense of government 
injustice, weak rules. Also, it can consist of half-hearted reforms, intellectual 
opposition, class division and antagonism, defeat or recruitment of armed forces by 
revolutionaries.</p>

  <li><h4><b>THE MODERATE STAGE</b></h4></li>
  <p>At this stage, the Revolution has begun in its peaceful attributes. Here, a call for a 
change is made or requested. Also, at this stage, participants try to compromise and 
seek reforms to the issues being clamoured for by the revolutionaries.</p>
  
    <li><h4><b>THE CRISIS STAGE</b></h4></li>
  <p>Here, this stage occurs as a result of the failure of parties to the Revolution to reach 
a satisfactory agreement. At this stage, there is an escalation of violence. Violence 
increases and more radical element on both side rear up. And so, revolutionary 
warfare occurs, especially in its more violent forms. Exhaustion or victory will lead 
to the end of this.</p>

    
    <li><h4><b>THE RECOVERY STAGE</b></h4></li>
    
   <p>At this stage, the Revolution is at its winding down phase. Here, hostilities are 
brought to an end. In this stage, the revolutionaries or counter-revolutionaries 
have achieved success, or the parties come to a mutual conclusion</p>
