    </div>
   <div>
	<h4>Short term ambush</h4>
<p>Short Term Ambush: This is an ambush planned and executed within l2hrs. In this case, the troops will be in the ambush site until the presence of the enemy <br>is noticed. If the enemy does not show up, then they can withdraw.</p>	
    <h3>Long term Ambush</h3>
<p>Long Term Ambush: This is the type of ambush which is deliberately planned and lasts more than 24hrs; sometimes it can last for days. In this case, an ambush<br> site is developed and occupied effectively by troops taking part. Regular relief should be ensured throughout the duration of the ambush to reduce fatigue.	</p>
    <h4>Manned Ambush</h4>
<p>This is the type of Ambush planned on the consist of men , is the type Ambush that is physically planed by troops.</p>	
    <h4>Unmanned Ambush</h4>
<p>This is type of ambush does not involve the occupation of the ambush site physically by troops. This ambush is carried using bobby traps, explosives and land mines.</p>
<p>Examples of Unmen Ambush</p>
  
	<h4>Area of Ambush</h4>
<p>Area of  Ambush. is used to cover several killing areas when it is uncertain which route the enemy will use or from which direction he will appear.</p>
    <h4>Linear Ambush</h4>

    <h3>Conduct/Stages of Ambush</h3>
<p>The following are stages of ambush:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Recce/preparatory stage</li>
	<li>Occupation stage.</li>
	<li>Springing/execution stage.</li>
	<li>Withdrawal stage.</li>
  </ol>	
  </div>
 <div>
  <lo>	
	<h4><li>Recce/preparatory stage</li></h4>
Recce/Preparatory Stage. This is the preparatory stage. Map recce of the ambush site or ground recce (if possible) should be conducted. After the <br>recce, clear briefing must prepared and delivered. Selection of site and position of the groups are clearly stated and interpreted to the all groups.<br> All information needed about the adversary must be clearly understood by the ambush party.	
	<h4><li>Occupation stage.</li></h4>
Occupation. We have the T shape and V shape method of occupation. The occupation begins immediately after the confirmatory recce party has returned.<br> At the dispersal point (which we may call Hide Out1 RV or Commando Base), the 3mbush party breaks into their. Various groups and move to occupy the ambush site from the near.	
	
	<h4>Springing/execution stage.</li></h4>	
Springing/Execution Stage. The signal for springing must be given by the Commander. Normally the Commander fires the first short to alert the groups. <br>Remember that the early warning group must give the early warning of the adversary approach either by use of twine of any other means that will not <br>reveal the ambush position to the adversary.
	
	<h4><li>Withdrawal stage.</li></h4>
Withdrawal stage. After, the commander orders the ceasefire, there must be searching (if need be) before withdrawal. The withdrawal must be by groups <br>and normally the protection group withdraws last. Signal for withdrawal must be clearly given by the Commander to avoid confusion. The ambush party <br>withdraws to a pre determined RV to avoid en counter attack or mortar

    <h3>Composition of Ambush Party/Task</h3>
<p>The following groups are involved in an ambush:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><h5>Early warning groups (left and right).</h5> Their task is to give early warning and to alert the commander of the adversary approach.</li>

	<h3>Principle of Ambush</h3>

  <li><h5>Execution. </h5> All mission  must be broke down into phases at all time. All troops must have perfect battle discipline.</li>
  <li><h5>Self Discipline.</h5> All troops must have self discipline. The commander can’t be everywhere, either can he see the whole groups. Therefore individuals are responsible for their own fire positions, camouflage and concealment and all must be determined to kill the enemy. There must be no smoking, <br>coughing unnecessarily or laughing.</li>
  <li><h5>Endurance.</h5>All troops  must be at alert observant for a long period of time. All must have the ability to endure even when the going gets tough.</li>

  <li><h5>Sitting.</h5> An ambush area needs to be sited carefully to allow all of the adversary to enter the area and prevent them from escaping.</li>
  <li><h5>Spring. </h5>Orders must be clearly spelt out such as when to spring and by whom the ambush will be sprung. The signal for opening fire must be been given clearly</li>
  <li><h5>Cease Fire.</h5> The order for cease fire must be given from the commander.</li>
  <li><h5>Administration. </h5>Good administration is very important eg supply of arms and ammunition, service support such as water,equipment and first aid. </li>
