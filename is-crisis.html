    <h1>Internal Security Crisis and insurgency in Africa: Causes, Types, Effects and</h1>
 </p>
  <section>
    <div>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
   
 <p> The problem of internal security crisis and insurgency cannot be properly understood nor 
decoded, unless the analysis and the interpretation of the underlining causes, types, 
effects and solution are premised on the contemporary global financial and economic 
crisis. The under currents of the inter connectedness between the contemporary nation 
states pose a fundamental challenge of the issues of internal security, conflict 
management and at development especially to the developing third world countries. 
In the contemporary world if has become extremely difficult to divorce internal 
security from external pressures. Indeed, internal security is symbiotically linked with 
the global politics and its other dynamics. For example while the revolution in the 
information technology has impacted positively on the global economic, it has also 
radicalized the perceptions of the victims of global politics on the issues of justice, 
poverty, ethnicity and inequalities arising from the contradiction of western 
imperialism. It has reawakened the minds of the oppressed to seek for justice and 
equity outside the framework of the nation state.</p>
 
<p>However, beside the external pressure in Africa internal politics affecting 
the growth and expected development of the economic poses a great threat to internal 
security. The proliferation of small and big arms in many parts of the Africa has 
resulted in the toughening or hardening of position between warring parties. 
Dangerous weapons including explosives are now readily available to criminals and 
terrorist groups. There by compounding the problems of internal security. There are 
other contending issues, for example, what precisely has made the African countries so 
volatile and vulnerable to all types of internal threat/security crisis, undermining the 
legitimacy of the nation states? What are the causes, types and the effects of internal 
security threat in the context of Africa? And how adequate are the mechanisms for 
the maintenance of internal security? Finally, what are the likely solutions that can 
extricate Africa form internal contradictions generating and promoting internal 
security? These contending issues form the thrust of this study.</p>

 <h3>The Global Financial and Economic Crisis and African’s Internal Security 
Problems a Major Contending Is</h3> 
 
 <p>It is evident that the global financial crisis has affected both poor and rich 
nations; the severity of the impact on individual countries will vary according to their 
economic, social, political and cultural settings. </p>
 
 <p>Accordingly, Soludo’s early optimism was dictated by the theory that 
economies without or with rudimentary financial markets connected or linked with 
the global economy are less likely to have financial crisis. However, everyone knows 
that he wanted to be positive because expressing doubt on the health of the banking 
sector would have triggered off serious national panic. The leaders have, however, 
started to sing different songs as they have realized that the society would not escape 
unharmed by the global financial crisis because Nigeria is part of the global economy. 
In fact, the impact of the global financial crisis has reached the shores of Nigeria as 
the fear of global economic recession has started to drive down oil prices. With all the 
twists and turns in the new global economy. Nigeria needs leaders who are committed 
to tackling the sociopolitical and economic problem facing the nation. There should 
be massive investment in the non-oil and agricultural sector of the economy, 
commitment to sustainable monetary and fiscal policies, and sufficient highly skilled 
personal to supervise the needed reforms and manage the affairs of the nation. As a 
nation with weak institutions and poor infrastructure, there will be high economic and 
human toll on Nigerian if the crisis in the new global economy is not resolved soon; 
as the economy worsens the level of public discontent is expected to increase. 
However the rising insecurity in Nigeria and the cloud of uncertainty surrounding the 
Goodluck Jonathan administration appear a much bigger threat to the Nigeria than the 
global financial crisis. Without proper planning and effective intervention the internal 
insecurity crisis rocking the nation state could transform the country’s longstanding 
economic problems into a social crisi</p>

     <h3>Internal Security Crisis and the Contending Issues: Causes, Types, Effect and 
Solution</h3>

 <p>Internal security is very critical to the functions of the state. The essence of 
the state is the promotion of good life and the creation of political conditions that 
would enhance the welfare of the citizenry. The state cannot perform the first primary 
purpose of the state unless maintenance of law and order is achieved. Therefore, 
internal security is quite an important aspect of national security/development. It was 
for lack of security that the Hobesian state of nature rendered life brutish, nasty and 
short. The concept goes back to the cradle of nation-states themselves. Armies for 
domestic peace-keeping and maintaining national sovereignty have existed since the 
dawn of recorded history. Civil and national police forces have also existed for 
millennia. Intelligence agencies and security services of government stretch back to 
antiquity such as the Roman Empire, Ottoma Empire and that of the Kanem Borno. 
While the general concepts of keeping a nation secure are not new, the specific 
modern English term “internal security” it came into common parlance in the 20th
century. Methodologies and strategies to achieve and maintain the highest possible 
desired state of internal security have been consistently developed over the modern 
period to this day. However, the concept of national or internal security is very 
difficult to define because the root term, security, has remained a contested concept. 
In other words, it has no universally accepted definition due to its many-sidedness 
arising from ideology and timeframe being addressed, as well as the locus of analysis.</p>
 
 <p>  At a general level, security simply suggest freedom from danger of threats, 
safety-or the ability of the state to protect and promote its cherished values and 
legitimate interest and enhance the well being of its people. Therefore, according to 
Imobighe, internal security may be conceptualized as the freedom from or the 
absence of those tendencies which could undermine internal cohesion and the 
corporate existence of the nation and its ability to maintain its vital institutions for the 
promotion of its core values and socio-political and economic objectives as well as 
meet the legitimate aspiration of the citizenry.  </p>
 
 <p>From the above it is crystal clear that internal security simply suggests 
freedom from threat and the ability of the government to create and sustain an 
atmosphere conducive for the pursuit of economic interest by the population without 
interruptions from anybody. And when there is a threat, it includes the ability of the 
government to quickly intervene to minimize the impact on the citizenry. 
Furthermore, it also includes the capacity of the government to create and maintain 
agencies and mechanism, and even institution that would guarantee freedom from 
danger. Therefore, threat to life and property be it from the armed robbers, Boko 
Haram attack, civil disturbances, road blocks that endangered the road users and other 
distractions are symptomatic of lack of internal security.</p>
 
  </p> From the above, it is evidently clear that internal security in organically 
linked with the peaceful coexistence among Nigeria’s multi-ethnic population. If 
there is danger, if there is threat to lives and property and if there are civil 
disturbances, riots, demonstrations, communal and religious conflicts and, if the 
governments lack the capacity to tackle these problems effectively, then the peaceful 
co-existence of the diverse multi-ethnic groups would suffer. </p>

     <h3>The Contending Issues (Causes, Types, Effects and Solutions)</h3>
     
 <p> The precarious security situation in Nigerian has shown very clearly that 
Nigerian is more threatened from within than from without or any external 
aggressors. In our attempt to explain the contending issues, unlike some other 
scholars who lumped the causes, forms and effects, a separation will be attempted 
here in order to address it from its root to give room for functional and effective 
solutions </p>      
     </div>

    <div>
     <h3>Causes of Internal Security Crisis in Nigeria</h3>
     
 <p> Many scholars have identified religious, political, intolerance, 
mismanagement of resources, subversion, sabotage, espionage, armed robbery, 
muting and coop d’état and so on as the main cause of internal security crisis in 
Nigeria. Yes they are, however, there are deeper structural problems arising from the 
inherent contradictions and that of the global financial economic crisis which are 
engendering conflicts and crisis that are manifesting in forms of political and 
religious, intolerance, corruption and resource mismanagement. These structural 
problems are: </p> 

   </div>
  <div>
   <ul>
    <li> Issues of good government and accountability that is still a mirage and
lacking among our leaders, be it at the local government, state government 
and federal level. The issue is also lacking in the private sector of the 
economy </li>
         
         <li> Poor nature and scope of economic development this centres on what has been happening
		 to poverty what has been happening to unemployment and what has been happening to inequality </li>          
             
        <li> The effects of rapid population growth on the economic development of Nigeria</li>
   
        <li> Electoral fraud as impediment to Nigeria’s search for internal security. 
Nigeria has a long history of electoral rigging and fraud that have been 
frustrating the wishes of the people to choose those who exercise political 
power. </li>            
      
         <li> Growing rate of poverty and the Hungary among Nigerians. </li>           
            
           <li>High rate illiteracy among Nigerians. The rate of illiteracy is very high in the 
country, figures from various education departments showed that education in 
some part of Nigeria has sustained a progressive decline over the years. The 
implication is that social, political and economic mobilization policies of the 
government do not trickle down to the majority of the youths and other 
agents of peace. </li>             
         
        </li> The consequence of corruption and unethical practice in Nigeria. Corruption 
is essentially the product of man’s greed for earthly grandeur, power and 
authority. It exists when an individual illegally or illicitly puts personal 
interest above those to the people and the ideals she or he is pledged to serve. 
Generally the in consequences of corruption and unethical practice in Nigeria 
are multi-dimensional and multi-faceted. The implications are overwhelming 
and have far reaching negative implications for internal security required for  the nations 
co-existence and development. These consequences include: poor 
leadership, underdevelopment, unemployment, concentration of wealth on the 
hands of a few, political instability, internal insecurity and discouragement of 
foreign investors e.t.c.</li>         
          </li>  
         <li>
        <li> Synergy between national security and democratic rule. The linkage between 
national security and democratic rule is that of mutual transmissibility of 
impacts and repercussions. Therefore, with prolonged years of military rule, 
it is expedient to note that only a democratic framework can provide succour 
to Nigerians at this critical security conjuncture, and create scope necessary 
for the transformation for the state from the authoritarian form experienced 
under the military rule to a people centered one. This will open up channels 
hitherto blocked for dialogue, negotiation and peaceful settlement of 
conflicts.</li>          
    </ul> 
 </div>

<p>Therefore, probably the nexus between national security crisis and 
democratic rule is like addressing the fundamental question-national security, whose 
security? If democracy is centered on the people and the people is said to mean the 
poor, disadvantaged, or the many, it therefore implies that for national security to be 
achieved to avoid crises, it must be people-oriented. Nigeria’s perception of security is a reflec </p>     
 
<p>Nigeria’s perception of security is a reflection of a realist paradigm of 
projecting its power within a state centric system. This perception is increasingly 
becoming problematic. This is because a state-centric perception in democratic rule is 
an anachronism, along with growing internal opposition to the hegemonic statist 
perspective of national security.</p>
  
 <p> Another synergy between security and democratic rule is seen in the huge 
budget on defense against public health, education, agriculture, and provision of 
essential services e.t.c. when you compare the budget allocation to national security 
and defense with other vital sectors mentioned above, the difference will justify 
where government priorities lies. However, the real security threat in Nigeria is the 
problem of underdevelopment, poverty, political instability and social injustice. These 
threats cannot be reasonably confronted by military preparedness.<p>   

<p>By implication therefore, we are all in a perpetual state of internal security 
crisis. As such security cannot be reasonably and adequately confronted by military 
preparedness.</p>      

 <p> Freeing people from those constraints that stop them from carrying out what 
freely they would choose to do of which war, poverty, oppression and poor 
education are a few… it is emancipation, not power and order, in theory and 
practice that leads to stable security.</p>

     <h3>Types of Internal Security Crisis in Nigeria</h3>
     
 <p> Types of Internal Security Crisis in Nigeria
We can now discuss the specific manifestation of the internal security threat 
the Nigeria nation has experienced for several decades now. First and foremost, 
Nigerian state has experienced violent eruptions arising from political, religious and 
ethnic conflicts, Professor Elaigwu has cited numerous conflicts that resulted in the 
loss of lives and properties between 1980-2003 in Nigeria while Alubo cited about 89 
between 1999 January 2004 (Elaigwu 2005, Alubo O. 2006). Most of these threats to 
the nation’s security involved the use of modern instruments of warfare and also 
essentially fought between majorities and minorities in several parts of the federation.  
 In each of the threats, the integrity of Nigerian nation has been drastically affected or 
at least questioned.
The following has been classified as the experienced manifestation of threat 
to the nation’s security    </p>
     </div>
    <div>
        <ul>
           
                
         <li> Controversial Census: Nigeria’s past experience of national censuses has 
not been pleasant; instead, it is replete and coloured with controversy 
based on regional or geopolitical and ethnic factors. Perhaps the most 
unfortunate thing about our economic planning was/is the failure 
successive government to conduct a successful census (Takaya, B. 1995).            </li>
        
        
       <li> Inter-Ethnic Rivalry: the inter-ethnic and religious communal protests 
have become an endemic phenomenon in Nigeria since independence. 
The know riot was a case in point. A cursory examination of the 
communal protests statistics confirms the negative role of primordial 
factors of religion and ethnicity. Of recent and even currently the 
communal protests cut across geo-political regions in Nigeria. 
  Some of these clashes had to the declaration of a state of emergency, 
traumatic and unhealthy upsurges suffered by those affected, and embarrassment on 
the national government on many occasions which had forces the government to give 
“short at sight orders”. </li>       
     
       <li> Revenue Allocation: this has been a long standing issue in Nigerian 
federalism. Being a plural society there has been agitation from the oil 
producing geo-political region that a fixed percentage of revenue accruing to 
the federation account directly from Natural resources are set aside as 
derivation for the region, perhaps this is to compensate communalities which 
suffer serve ecological degradation arising from the exploitation mineral 
resources in their areas.  </li>       
  
        <li> National Conference it was/is an attempt to address the problems arising from 
the constitution that led to a Clarion call by ethnic minorities for the 
constitutional national conference to determine the future of Nigeria as a 
political entity. The neglect of this call raises internal security threat 
especially in the south east and south west political zones.    
 Federal Character: the federal character principle is a derivative of the 
plurality of the Nigeria society. It was to serve as positive steps to correct the 
political imbalances which have disadvantaged sections of the Nigeria  </li>  
  
        <li>  Geo-political zoning of Leadership: the complexity of the Nigerian society 
also called for a modified and peculiar presidential system in which six key 
executive and legislative offices are zoned and allowed to rotate among six 
identifiable geographical groups. In the implementation of this provision, the 
country had been divided into six zones. <li>       
        
        <ol>
          <li>North East</li>
          <li>North West</li>
          <li>North Central</li>
          <li>South West</li>
          <li>South East</li>
          <li>Southern Minority (South South)</li>
        <p>  However the zoning of these key offices has only led to the marginalization 
of the minorities in choice of leaders outside their zone.</p>
        </ol>  
    </li>
         <li>
      Leadership it appears Nigerian leadership is grafted on ethnic loyalty. Nigeria 
leaders still show this overtly or covertly in either administration. Such 
elements of ethnic and religion affinity still to divide Nigerians and 
encourage centrifugal forces to prevail.

        <li>
    Wrong use of Security Agencies: the use of police, armed forces and security 
operatives to suppress, intimidate and subvert popular will has further 
brewed distaste and animosity between the people and security personal. As 
perceived agents for propagating unpopular state policies and for subverting 
the electoral process in elections, the task of creating healthy civil-police, 
civil-military and paramilitary relations will for all intent and purpose 
become more elusive.        
        </li> 
         <li>Existence of Political Militias: the tendency by the political parties to arm 
jobless youths for purpose of elections and other evil act has multiple 
effects on society. The task of disarming these elements is largely 
unsuccessful thereby increasing the rate of violent crimes, inter and intra-
communal strife and security crisis</li>
         
         <li>
             Monetization of the Political Process: this has restricted political participation 
particularly at the highest levels to only those who can afford it.

     <h3>Effects of Internal Security Crisis</h3>
   
<p>Internal security in Nigeria has both short and long term consequences. In the short 
term, when mobilized cultural symbols charge people to violent action. The 
immediate effects are devastation both calculated and mob action lead to massacres 
and widespread losses of human capital-warriors, community leaders, vibrant youths, 
entrepreneurs, occupational specialist, husbands, wives, children etc. There are also 
devastations of property-houses, farmland and crops, farm equipment, live stocks and 
vehicles e.t.c.</p>

<p>In additions, there has been increased urban violence coordinated by ethnic 
militia. The intra-ethnic conflicts have graduated from more outburst of violence in 
Lagos, Kaduna, Zaria, Kano, Jos, Suleja and other cities to a near war situation in the 
South-South. The security situation in the country has become so precious that 
hostage taking of oil worked and some government officials, vandalization of oil pipe 
lines, kidnapping bomb blast of religious places market and schools are becoming 
uncontrollable.</p>
 
  <p> Presently secessionist movement have emerged such as the movement for the 
actualization of the sovereign state of Biafra (MASSOB), the “Taliban” and the 
“Boko Haram” groups in north east, agitating for the reconstruction of Nigeria as an 
Islamic country and the abolishment of western culture especially education. There 
are also volunteer forces in the Nigeria delta demanding control of the oil wealth. All 
these new rebellions movement constitute threat to the internal security of Nigeria 
and obstacles against national integration and development.   </p>   
     
 <p>  There is also a deployment of government troops, the Nigeria police, mobile 
police, army, and navy to quell or control some of these internal security threats. 
Beside the government normally set up commissions of enquiry to examine the 
remote and immediate causes of these conflicts. All of these activities have led to a 
diversion of scares resources, human, material and finance to resolve such conflicts. </p>     
   
 <p> The incidence of mismanagement of resources is well known and do not 
deserve our comment here. Except to agree that, energy kobo stolen in Nigeria 
contribute to national insecurity. It simply means the weakening of state capacity to 
provide the basic needs of the people. People are forced into all lands of criminality 
because of their poor material existence. This assumption is at the root of at armed 
robberies, human trafficking drug abuse, prostitution, etc, that have become in recent 
times </p>      
     
<p>There is also the problem of subversion - a calculated move or series of 
clandestine activities designed to undermine the nation’s governmental set-up. 
Sabotage/ vandalization, the deliberate destructions of an industrial process, including 
the human and natural resources or public utilities as well as sensitive military, oilinstallation 
in order to grind the nations to a halt! Moreover, espionage, smuggling, 
influx of alien and political assassination constitute real threat to national security.</p>           
   
 <p> image in the international community: internal security threat has 
lowered the image of the country and makes it unattractive in the eyes of the 
international community. The international community deals with nations with 
security threat with a lot of deep-seated fear and suspicions. Nigeria is no longer 
respected globally and many investors are forced to relocate to other west African 
countries due to threat to lives and properties  </p>     

  <p> Underdevelopment of the Country: internal security crisis 1960’s is 
responsible for the ills of Nigeria. It is responsible for poor standard and lack of 
public utilities such as roads, unstable electing supply, and low standard of schools. 
Because of internal security crisis and real threat to providers and facilitators of those 
facilities.  </p>   
  
 <p> Unemployment: large scale eruptions of ethnic religious and other conflicts 
witness in this nations has discouraged investors especially the private sector. 
Consequently the teeming youths who graduate from educational institutions remain 
unemployment and idle in the major cities. These youths engage in anti-social vices 
such as armed robbery, drug abuse, prostitution, vandalism, cultism etc, in order to 
make ends meet.</p>      
     
 <p> Low Foreign Direct Investment: Foreign investors become discouraged in 
investing in nations that will reduce the investors’ competitive advantage due to 
internal security threat. Nigeria since the intensification of internal security threats 
has been losing the benefit of the current globalization dividends and phenomenon. </p>      
     
 <p> It affects the stability of government: loyalties are fragmented by thoughts of 
fear and improbabilities, thereby destabilizes the institutions of the state. The 
efficiency and efficacy of institutions of both public and private as decisions-making 
process is not only slowed down but also is incoherent and often irrational when a 
nation faces internal security crisis.</p>

 <p> Flight of Graduates: internal security threat causes talented and skilled people 
to seek employment outside the country rather than stay and engage themselves in 
productive activities for the nation’s development. Out of fear, and threat to lives and 
properties some Nigerian university graduates prefer to live and work in Europe, 
America and some Arab countries even with less salaries and loss of dignity.  </p>

     <h3>Solutions to the Internal Security Crisis in Nigerian</h3>
	 
  <p> From the foregoing we can clearly see the damaging consequences of internal 
security threats as shown in different perspective. However, how has the Nigerian 
state managed her internal security crisis? What are the available mechanisms for minimizing the impact 
of these activities? The instruments of internal security are 
those agencies vested with the responsibility of internal security of any given country. 
The instruments can be divided into two categories namely the coercive and non-
coercive. The coercive instruments are the armed forces (the Army, Navy and air 
force and the Nigerian police force). The non coercive instruments are those agencies 
whose activities must of necessity not attract public attention. These are State 
Security Service (SSS), the Custom and Exercise Department, the Immigration 
Department, the Nigerian Prison Service, the Federal and State Fire Service, the 
Security Unit of Cabinet Office, the Judiciary, Civil Defense and the Federal Road 
Safety Corps Marshal and some established by some state government in South East, 
West and South-South.</p>
  
  The political use of the above agencies and paucity of funds have distorted 
their functions. The military is capable but it is primarily trained to protect the 
territorial integrity of the nations. In situation where they have been invited, it has 
been tragedies because of the impact of their mortal shell! While the Nigerian police 
in spite of the change of symbols to policing with integrity. The public perception of 
their role has hardly changed it is evidence that Nigerian police are poorly trained and 
poorly equipped. The society is very hostile to them. They are yet to be trusted! Road 
users are intimidated to pay tithes at road blocks. The police commission can still do 
something <p>
